# **Choti URL**

### **Your one-stop solution for short, shareable links.**

Are you tired of long, unwieldy URLs? Choti URL (meaning "Short URL" in Hindi) is a robust and efficient URL shortening service built with modern technologies. It allows users to transform long links into short, manageable ones, perfect for sharing on social media, in emails, or anywhere else.

### **âœ¨ Features**

* **URL Shortening**: Easily create compact, trackable short URLs.  
* **Custom Aliases**: Personalize your short URLs with custom, human-readable names (e.g., choti.myproject).  
* **Click Analytics**: Track the number of clicks on each of your shortened links in real-time.  
* **Search & Manage**: Find and manage your shortened URLs by ID, short URL, or long URL.  
* **URL Redirection**: Seamlessly redirect users from the short URL to the original destination.  
* **Built-in Expiration**: Each short URL is set to expire after a certain period to keep the database clean and efficient.
